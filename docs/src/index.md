# What is MadDiff?
MadDiff.jl is a simple algebraic modeling/differentiation package. MadDiff.jl constructs first and second derivative functions off-line (i.e., prior to calling the optimization solver) by applying operator overloading-based automatic differentiation on _functions_. The exact _derivative functions_ can be obtained as results.
